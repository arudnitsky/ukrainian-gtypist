Using the GNU Typist reference in the attached file, create a GNU Typist .typ file to drill Ukrainian keyboard letters. Add drills for the home row, upper row and lower row. The letters in each drill must be in a random order. Each drill should contain a minumum of 25 letters. Create 5 drills for single letters for each row, 5 drills for home + upper single letters, 5 drills for home + lower single letters, 5 drills for upper row + lower row. Add 5 drills for common Ukrainian digraphs and letter combinations. Add 5 drills for transitioning between rows. Finally, add 5 drills with more complex sentences and paragraphs. Make each set of drills available as a menu item. Use asterisks instead of underscores to in label definitions to ensure proper label syntax. Ensure there is a *:MENU label before the main menu. Ensure all submenus return to their previous menu. Ensure proper syntax for all drill definitions. Use Ukrainian for all user-visible text.
